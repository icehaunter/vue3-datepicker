<script setup>
import Datepicker from '../src/datepicker/Datepicker.vue'
import { ref } from 'vue'
const picked = ref(new Date())

</script>

# Introduction

This is a reimplementation of [vuejs-datepicker](https://github.com/icehaunter/vuejs-datepicker) in Vue 3 and with greatly cleaned up code.

All date manipulation and formatting are done via the amazing [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/) library, so it's a direct dependency of this picker.

## Example

Datepicker comes with styling, but input itself does not. Attributes fall through to the `input` element, so you can use classes and styles as you would on any input.

<Datepicker v-model="picked" />

## Installation

Package is available on NPM: [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vue3-datepicker)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue3-datepicker)

```sh
npm i vue3-datepicker
```

Then import it in your code and use as a usual component:

```vue
<script setup>
import Datepicker from 'vue3-datepicker'
import { ref } from 'vue'
const picked = ref(new Date())
</script>

<template>
  <Datepicker v-model="picked" />
</template>
```

## Compatibility

Package is transpiled and should be usable for everyone with ES6 and above, but the styling of the datepicker itself uses CSS Grid and CSS variables.

Package uses typescript and ships with TS declarations for its components.

## Props and attributes

Attribute fallthrough is enabled, so any attribute you apply to the component will be passed down to the input.

All props which accept formatting strings for dates use [`date-fns` formatting function](https://date-fns.org/docs/format) under the hood, so see that function's documentation for patterns.

Main interaction to date selection is done via `v-model` with `Date` as expected type of the value passed.

More in-depth documentation of the props, as well as examples, can be found in [Configuration](/config)

### Events

- `opened`: Emitted every time the popup opens, including on field focus
- `closed`: Emitted every time the popup closes, including on field blur

## Styling

Styling is done via CSS variables, which control colors used in the popup. All variables, as well as styling example and playground can be found in [Configuration section](/config.html#styling-example-and-playground)
